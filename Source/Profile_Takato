Profile Takato

Official

For all intents and purposes, Takato is a very normal boy. He is a cheerful and carefree person who loves Digimon, the Digimon card game, and drawing. He is gentle, sensitive, and true to his feelings, which makes him very emotive. He is a very imaginative and creative person, which is the reason he made Guilmon up, though his imagination often gets the best of him. He is inexperienced as a Tamer, but makes up for it with his enthusiasm and his honest love for Digimon. Takato cares deeply for others, and when he is thrust into situations where people's lives are at stake, he treats the situation with appropriate seriousness and does his best to help out. However, he is easily upset when he thinks he has failed to protect his loved ones; he cries when he thinks he has been a bad Tamer to Guilmon, and is sent into rage when Leomon is killed. As Takato gains experience, he is able to control his feelings better, and his perception of the enemy changes, judging the opponents by their actions rather than instantly thinking of them as "bad guys".

Takato is an only child. His parents run their own bakery, and the family lives in an apartment right above it. He sometimes helps out in the bakery, so he knows how to make bread. He has a grandfather and cousin, Wataru and Kai Urazoe, who live in Okinawa.

Takato has a crush on Jeri Katou, which he openly admits twice throughout the series. 

At first, Takato isn't very good at battling.

Fanon:

Takato in this story I want to be a frenemy of sorts to Satoshi, a classic rival. At first he doesn't have guilmon, but gains it in the middle of the hypnos arc. I want takato and satoshi to butt heads over Eevee.
