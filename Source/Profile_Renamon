Profile_Renamon

Official:
Renamon became Rika's partner after Rika received her D-Power, shortly after a Digimon Cards tournament. Many Digimon seemed to want Rika as their Tamer, but Rika said she only wanted one strong Digimon as a partner. Then a blue card appeared, and Rika swiped it through her Card Reader, and it became her own D-Power. Rika then wished that Renamon was her partner, and Renamon remained as Rika's companion throughout the Tamers season.

At first, Renamon's view on humans was that humans were nothing more but an aid for battle and digivolution for Digimon. The pair had a distant relationship, similar to that of a noble and a samurai retainer; Renamon's only allegiance at first is to Rika and it is absolute. However, as time passed, the bond between Digimon and Tamer strengthened throughout various battles, and through these endeavors, their friendship grew stronger. This was first realized after Renamon, critically injured in a battle with a Dokugumon, was able to evolve into Kyubimon following Rika's outburst of emotion at the loss of her partner. It reached its zenith when their emotional ties enabled the final Biomerge that sparked Sakuyamon's birth. While Renamon liked to battle enemies, much like an honorable samurai would, Renamon would respect the fact that there were some battles she didn't have to fight and wouldn't interfere if Renamon deemed it unnecessary.

Renamon forms friendships with Guilmon and Terriermon but initially struggles in befriending Guilmon, due to his childish personality. Renamon was seen to be very empathetic with Impmon due to his struggles. She seems somewhat concerned for Impmon's safety and upon leaving the Digital World, Renamon feels the urgency to rescue Impmon despite the issues he had caused.
