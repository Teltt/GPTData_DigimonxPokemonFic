After leaving Eevee in the park, Satoshi thinks about the ethics of Digimon. He calls Professor Rowan, who advises that he tries to see eye to eye with Eevee. Professor Rowan starts asking Satoshi about his world, curious to learn about the differences between the world of Pokemon and that of Digimon.

The episode begins with Takato immersed in his usual routine of playing cards with Kazu and Kenta.

While at the park, Takato notices something peculiar in the bushes but dismisses it. He overhears some kids spreading rumors about a mysterious creature lurking in the park, which sparks his curiosity.

Determined to uncover the truth, Takato explores the park in search of this enigmatic being. Eventually, he comes across Eevee, who is peacefully napping in the sun. Eevee wakes up upon sensing Takato's presence and surprises him with its ability to speak. Takato is astounded to learn about Eevee's existence which makes him think about if Digimon exist.

As Takato tries to process this revelation, Satoshi arrives on the scene. Satoshi apologizes to Eevee but finds it challenging to fully comprehend their bond. He becomes increasingly competitive with Takato. Eevee decides to stay with Takato.

While leaving the scene, Takato spots Henry carrying around Terriermon. Suspecting Terriermon is real, Takato approaches Henry and asks about Terriermon. Henry warms up to Takato as they discover their shared passion for Digimon. Satoshi looks at them longingly.

Later, a digital field starts chasing Henry who is with Takato, Gorillamon. Gorrillamon chases them to a building sceduled for demolition.

Henry and Terriermon argue over whether or not to fight Gorillamon, with Terriermon wanting to protect their friends and Henry trying to avoid conflict. Satoshi intervenes and helps them understand the importance of balance between fighting when necessary and avoiding unnecessary conflict.

Takato, Henry, and Satoshi work together to confront Gorillamon. Satoshi captures it, realizing that he now has friends who share his passion for both Pokemon and Digimon.

The episode concludes with Takato enthusiastically sketching a new drawing featuring Eevee, Terriermon, and the other Digimon he has discovered, daydreaming about having a partner of his own.
