Profile_Guilmon

Official:
Guilmon is a virus-type Digimon, though his attitude and kindness most of the time could lead to thinking that he was a data or even a vaccine-type. Guilmon's fighting style, in which he gives in to his bestial nature, exhibits his viral nature, as he fights with much more zeal and ferocity than Agumon or other Digimon protagonists, as his partner, Takato Matsuki, intended on when he came up with Guilmon.

Though he doesn't look it, Guilmon is normally playful and friendly, proving to be quite popular with Takato's classmates for being a real live Digimon. Despite being portrayed as childlike, Guilmon occasionally shows deep insight. For example, when Takato didn't want Guilmon to digivolve, in fear that Guilmon would no longer be the same, Guilmon pointed out that Takato has changed over time as well, but he is still the same person.

Guilmon gets along very well with Terriermon and Calumon, but his first meeting with Renamon was as enemies. Guilmon later acknowledges Renamon's knack for "being right" in combat situations. Guilmon would either ignore Impmon or try to play with him.

At first, Guilmon wasn't very good at listening to Takato, always breaking out of his cage, and fighting Renamon when Takato told him not to. Guilmon admired Takato's determination after he worked frantically to reverse Guilmon's first digivolution, and has since obeyed Takato's every word.

In the Japanese version, Guilmon has a habit of speaking in third person. This includes referring to others by their name rather than "you" and referring to himself in third-person tone. He mostly seems to alternate between this and the use of pronouns throughout the series, although he typically only does this as Guilmon and Growlmon. He also stops his "Takatomon" habit much earlier in this version, though he continues doing it a little bit throughout the rest of the English version.
