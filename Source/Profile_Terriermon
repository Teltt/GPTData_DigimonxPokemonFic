Profile_Terriermon

Official:

Terriermon started out as a wild Digimon, living by the doctrine of "survival of the fittest" in the harsh realm of the Digital World. When Henry received a Digimon video game as a present from his father, he selected Terriermon to play with because he identified with him. During a battle between Terriermon and Gorillamon, Henry caused Terriermon to Digivolve into Gargomon, but Gargomon lost control of his powers and was nearly unconscious when he degenerated, encouraging Henry to regret Terriermon's digivolution. Soon after, the mysterious Blue Card was discovered among Henry's card collection. Henry swiped the card through his card reader, transforming it into a D-Power. Terriermon then Bio-Emerged into the Real World as Henry's partner. Because of Terriermon's near-death experience, Henry strongly discouraged fights, even against attacking Digimon. However, when they needed to protect a child from a rampaging Musyamon, Henry learned that there were some things worth fighting for, and eased off.

At first, Henry hid Terriermon from his family by having Terriermon act like a simple stuffed animal, who his sister called "Princess Pretty Pants". Later, Terriermon met the other Tamers, and became fast friends with Guilmon (Takato's partner).

Terriermon also has a laid-back personality—and often uses the phrase, "Moumantai" (written as 無問題 or 无问题), a Cantonese phrase that means "take it easy ", "Relax " or more commonly, "not a problem".

Terriermon was the first Digimon to Digivolve into champion level in Digimon Tamers (though this was accidental due to the situation).
