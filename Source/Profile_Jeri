Profile Jeri

Official
Usually shown with her sock puppet early on in the series, Jeri is a cheerful and sweet person who is always there to encourage her friends, though later in the series she descends into despair after the death of her Digimon partner. It is made clear that Takato Matsuki has a crush on her, and the feeling is mutual.[3]

Jeri's family owns a small tavern in Shibuya, where she works sometimes waitressing and even helping her father to handle drunk customers, as she says when she's kidnapped by Orochimon in the Digital World. Her father is a good-hearted but very severe person who didn't know how to handle raising Jeri after his wife's death and became distant towards her as a result; at first he's seen as strict and cold, but that facade breaks when he tries to rescue Jeri on his own after she's kidnapped by the D-Reaper. Jeri's step-mother, Shizue, is very kind to her, and she seems to have a very loving relationship with her younger half-brother Masahiko. 

Fanon:
Jeri is both a fan of Digimon and Pokemon, having many rare cards, she's afraid of being rejected for her interests, so she doesn't know how to play. She's somewhat out there sometimes, but has a very good mind. She's willing to try and be friends with Satoshi every once in awhile. Jeri doesn't obtain Leomon in this story, but instead gets Pokemon (piplup) from professor Rowan. Jeri becomes withdrawn in the Pokemon world, missing home mirroring her Leomon arc.

Jeri could be the one who encourages Satoshi to be more empathetic towards Digimon and think beyond capturing them. Perhaps, she can help resolve conflicts within the group, such as the tension between Satoshi and the other Tamers.

eri's love for both Digimon and Pokemon becomes a crucial aspect of her character, as she uses her knowledge of both to help her friends. She becomes an essential part of Satoshi's growth, as she helps him understand the importance of treating Digimon and Pokemon as friends, rather than just collectible creatures.
During their journey, Jeri and Satoshi's relationship deepens as they learn from each other and support each other's growth. Jeri helps Satoshi become a more compassionate trainer and friend, while Satoshi helps Jeri overcome her fears and embrace her interests fully.
A subplot involving Jeri's family could add emotional depth to her character, as she struggles with the distance and absence from her loved ones. The contrast between her relationships with her step-mother and biological father adds complexity to her character and allows for further growth and development.
