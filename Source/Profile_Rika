Profile Rika Nonaka

Rika's personality has evolved throughout the series. Initially, she was a merciless tamer seeking only to make her partner Digimon as strong as possible, and had a rough relationship with her mother. She would criticize and blame Renamon for their losses, and treat every other Digimon as her enemy, including Guilmon and Terriermon. Though she often covered up her true feelings with a tough girl act, she showed how she really cared about Renamon at the first few instances of Renamon's Digivolutions. During a fateful fight against Harpymon, Rika showed that she was willing to risk her own life to protect Renamon. After this fight, Rika began opening up to Takato and Henry as well, eventually becoming friends with both of them. She still continues to throw her sarcastic remarks here and there and displays her annoyance to Kenta and Kazu's foolery, also she shows dislike towards Ryo and his attempts to win her heart. But she seems to care about Jeri, motivating and comforting her in times of need. Of all the characters in the season, Rika has arguably shown the greatest change in personality.
