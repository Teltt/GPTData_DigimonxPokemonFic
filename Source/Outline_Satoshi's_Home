episode 1
Outline Satoshi's Home:

The episode begins by introducing Satoshi, a young boy who dreams of becoming a Pokemon master. We see glimpses of his daily life, including his routine of packing up his Pokemon cards early and walking to school alone, without friends to play cards with.

At school, Satoshi doesn't get along with his classmates Takato, Kenta, and Kazu. He daydreams in class and makes a wish to become a Pokemon master someday.

After school, we learn that Satoshi lives at an animal caretaking place. There, he finds a blue disc and inserts it into his computer, which causes the printer to malfunction and spit out Deevee, a Pokedex, and a box that produces Pokeballs at the push of a button.

Satoshi and Deevee spend time watching a compilation of Pokemon battles from the anime together. Satoshi dreams of one day becoming a Pokemon master like the trainers in the videos. Deevee watches the battles intently and admires the strength and determination of the Pokemon.

 Satoshi bumps a button on his Pokedex which surprisingly starts a video call with Professor Rowan, who after finding out his world is fictional in Satoshi's world, asks Satoshi to take care of Deevee once he finds out about Deevee Satoshi agrees, Satoshi asks how Deeve got her and Rowan admits that he doesn't know how Deevee travelled to a world where Pokemon are fictional, and why the Pokedex recognizes Deevee as a pokemon seperate from Eevee.
