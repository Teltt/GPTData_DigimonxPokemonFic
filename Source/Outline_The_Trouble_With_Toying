Outline The trouble with Toying:

The episode starts with Satoshi showing off Deevee at school, forcing Deevee to pretend to be a plush. As they pass by the park, a bioemergence happens and a strange Digimon appears. Deevee tries to warn Satoshi, but he ignores Deevee and continues to show off his "plush" to his friends.


During the morning, Deevee is constantly messed with by the bioemergent Digimon, and Satoshi doesn't even notice.

 during lunch, Satoshi runs into Henry and Terriermon. Terriermon has some choice words for Satoshi about forcing Deevee to pretend, but Satoshi avoids him and heads back to class.
 
 afterschool, Deevee's stomach growls and Satoshi realizes that he can't force Deevee to pretend any longer. He decides to let Deevee out to play in the park near the school.
 
As they play, the bioemergent Digimon reappears, and Deevee is put in danger. Deevee comes to Satoshi for help, and Satoshi tries to capture the Digimon with a Pokeball. However, before he can do so, Henry and his partner Terriermon show up, and they both engage in a battle with the Digimon.

During the fight, Satoshi realizes the error of his ways and apologizes to Deevee for ignoring him earlier. Together, they all work to restrain the Digimon and save the day. Just as they are about to capture the Digimon, Rika and Renamon swoop in and load the Digimon's data, putting an end to the fight.

In the end, Satoshi learns a valuable lesson about respecting his partner and treating him as an equal. He also gains a newfound respect for Henry and his partner, and the two of them become friends.
