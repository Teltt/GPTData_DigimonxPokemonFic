episode 4
Outline Renamon Step and Destroy:

Digimental: Courage
The episode begins with Satoshi and Henry, along with their partners Deevee and Terriermon, successfully capturing bioemerging Digimon in Pokeballs. From a distance, Rika interferes and Renamon loads the data, Satoshi notices Rika and henry asks why she kills digimon, Rika tells henry that Digimon are just data, and that Renamon will load that data to become strong before walking away.

Satoshi and Henry later have a conversation discussing the ethics of capturing and containing bioemerging Digimon instead of destroying them. Satoshi sees it as a way to protect both the real world and the Digimon, while Henry expresses concerns about the consequences of such actions.

Later, Rika confronts Henry, challenging his approach and insisting that Renamon needs to absorb data to grow stronger. Henry tries to reason with her, explaining that there might be alternative ways to help Renamon evolve without resorting to aggression. Rika, however, remains skeptical and dismissive of Henry's perspective.

A powerful bioemerging Digimon appears at an abandoned building due for demolition, causing chaos. Satoshi, Henry, Rika, and their partners rush to confront the threat. During the battle, Rika's aggressive approach puts her and Renamon at risk, forcing Satoshi and Henry to step in and assist.

Despite the intense battle and Renamon absorbing the data, Renamon does not evolve, leaving Satoshi to wonder about Rika's motivations and the relationship between her and Renamon. In the aftermath, Rika leaves hastily. Rika is shown thinking about how Renamon needs to grow stronger, and wondering if there's another way before dismissing the idea.
