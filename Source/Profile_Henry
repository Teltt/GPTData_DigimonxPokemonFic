Profile Henry Wong:

Official:
Henry is a very calm and levelheaded boy, much more mature than an average boy his age. Henry is a pacifist, and prefers not to fight if he can help it. This is because when he was a young boy and just started learning martial arts, he used his newfound skills to injure another boy, something he wasn't supposed to do and regrets deeply. As a Tamer, Henry understands that fighting is sometimes necessary, and learns to balance between good fights and bad ones, though he remains a very non-aggressive person. Though quiet and introverted, Henry is nevertheless a very amiable and approachable person, and is quite a good friend. He is very intelligent and a good strategist, and somewhat into computers. 

Fan addons:

Henry likes how Satoshi can end a battle with capturing a digimon but questions the ethics of keeping them locked up, ( a pokeball breakout episode could be a nice plot, where one of the tamers or Kazu Kenta or Jeri lets them loose) Henry tries not to criticize satoshi, and instead gives advice when asked for, such as when Satoshi is thinking about how Deevee left him for Takato.
